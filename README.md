## Introduction

How can we solve semi-supervised node classification in various types of graphs possibly with noisy features and structures?

We propose SlimG, which exhibits the folloiwing desirable properties:
- C1.1 - **Accurate**, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, almost always winning or tying in the first place.
- C1.2 - **Robust**, being able to handle numerous real settings such as homophily, heterophily, no network effects, useless features.
- C1.3 - **Fast and Scalable**, using carefully chosen features, it takes only 32 seconds on million-scale real-world graphs (ogbn-Products) on a stock server.
- C1.4 - **Interpretable**, learning the largest weights on informative features, ignoring noisy ones, based on the linear decision function.

We also explain the reasons for its success, thanks to our three additional contributions:
- C2 - **Explanation**: We propose GNNExp, a framework for the systematic linearization of a GNN.
- C3 - **Sanity Checks**: We propose seven possible scenarios of graphs (homophily, heterophily, no network effects, etc.), which reveal the strong and weak points of each GNN.
- C4 - **Experiments**: We conduct extensive experiments to better understand the success of SlimG even with its simplicity.

## Usage
The code is written in Python 3.10.8 and built on a number of packages.

Please see "requirements.txt" for the package details.

To run the code, you can simply use the following comment:
`python src/main.py`

The datasets will be automatically downloaded when running for the first time.
